Welcome to the ExplorerScript Boundary Test! The idea of the site is to test if lines of text written in ExplorerScript fits in a the game's text box.
All characters should have the right size, but let me know if I messed up any symbol! The textbox is multi-line so you can check as many lines as you want.
These special symbols are supported, with some modifications:

    \b - Shows the chat Bubble that the games sometimes use
    \n - New Line
    \' - '
    \" - "
    [hero] [partner] [CS:X] - Displays "wcwcwcwcw" that should be the max allowed size for a name

Everything else in brackets gets ignored. If I missed some useful and common tag of symbol, or you want some other feature implemented, or just want to correct me on my grammar (please do), let me know, I'm DasK on SkyTemple's Discord!
